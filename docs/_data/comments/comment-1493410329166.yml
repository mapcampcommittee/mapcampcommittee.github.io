message: "What you said made a great deal of sense. But, think on this, suppose you composed a catchier title?\r\nI ain't saying your content isn't solid, but suppose you added \r\nsomething to maybe grab a person's attention? I mean Map Camp - Map Camp \r\nis kinda vanilla. You should glance at Yahoo's front \r\npage and note how they create article titles to grab people to open the \r\nlinks. You might add a related video or a pic or two to get people excited \r\nabout everything've got to say. In my opinion, it could \r\nmake your posts a little livelier."
