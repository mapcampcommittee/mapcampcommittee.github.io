  <h1>What is Map Camp?</h1>
  <p>It started as a tweet from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/827140829877850112">Simon Wardley</a> asking if anyone would like to have <em>"a small meetup in London on mapping"</em>. It had so much interest that it quickly turned into a full day event. Map Camp is now a series of events including workshops and talks about mapping techniques used in organisations.</p>
