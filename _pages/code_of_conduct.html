<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Map Camp should be a safe environment for all and we will do everything we can to make sure that it is.</p>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of
  conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help
  ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>For general assistance, please <a href="https://map-camp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">join us on
    Slack</a> or direct message via Twitter Holger Gelhausen (@holgergelhausen) or John Grant (@jhngrant).</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
  gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
  religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any
  form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties,
  Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
  conference <em>without a refund</em> or compensation at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images
  in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
  disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images,
  activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
  clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
  including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
  member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing
  and/or badges.</p>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide
  escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value
  your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
